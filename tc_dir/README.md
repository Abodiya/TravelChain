# TravelChain: Decentralized Travel Experience Marketplace

## Project Overview

TravelChain is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging smart contracts to create a peer-to-peer marketplace for unique travel experiences. This platform connects travelers with local hosts, allowing for direct bookings and secure transactions without intermediaries.

## Features

- **Experience Listing**: Hosts can create and list unique travel experiences.
- **Direct Bookings**: Travelers can book experiences directly from hosts.
- **Premium Subscriptions**: Users can subscribe to premium traveler status for added benefits.
- **Revenue Distribution**: Automatic and transparent revenue sharing between hosts and the platform.
- **Governance**: Basic governance features for future community-driven development.

## Smart Contract Overview

The core of TravelChain is a Clarity smart contract that manages the following key aspects:

1. **User Roles**:
   - Administrators
   - Experience Hosts
   - Premium Travelers

2. **Experience Management**:
   - Listing new experiences
   - Booking experiences
   - Tracking bookings and revenue

3. **Financial Operations**:
   - Processing payments for bookings
   - Handling premium subscriptions
   - Tracking host and platform revenue

4. **Governance**:
   - Proposal system for future enhancements

5. **Security and Access Control**:
   - Role-based access control
   - Pausable contract functionality

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Clarity
- **Blockchain**: Stacks
- **Key Data Structures**:
  - Maps for experiences, user roles, and revenue tracking
  - Data variables for contract state and configuration

## Getting Started

To interact with the TravelChain smart contract:

1. Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain.
2. Use a Stacks wallet (e.g., Hiro Wallet) to interact with the contract.
3. Administrators should initialize the contract post-deployment.

## Key Functions

- `register-as-host`: Allows users to register as experience hosts.
- `list-experience`: Enables hosts to list new travel experiences.
- `book-experience`: Allows travelers to book listed experiences.
- `subscribe-premium`: Users can subscribe to premium traveler status.

## Governance

The contract includes a basic structure for governance proposals, allowing for future community-driven development and decision-making.

## Security Considerations

- The contract includes pause functionality for emergency situations.
- Access control is implemented for administrative functions.
- Users should review and understand the smart contract before interacting with it.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a rating and review system for experiences and hosts.
- Develop a front-end application for easier interaction with the contract.
- Expand governance features for more community involvement.
